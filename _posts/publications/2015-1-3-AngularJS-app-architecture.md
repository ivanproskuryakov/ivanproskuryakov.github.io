Architecture and code design are  the most important parts of development process.
Applications without architecture with complicated functionality: users, content management,
categorisation, tagging, reviews, are almost impossible to maintain, work on issues & fix the bugs.

An app with no organisation consumes more time, and a chance that you forgot something and will
have an issue later on, dramatically increases. Whether we want it or not, we will start thinking
about the code re-organisation.

Otherwise, an app designed with standard architecture give us a possibility to decompose functionality,
or semantically group  the same parts into modules. This gives a possibility to delegate different
development stages to different teams, e.g. team A will work on User Functionality, team B will be
responsible for content management etc..
