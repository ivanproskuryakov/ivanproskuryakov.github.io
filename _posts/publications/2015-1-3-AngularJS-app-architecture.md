Architecture and code design is most important part of development process.
Applications without architecture with complicated functionality: users, content management, categorisation, tagging,
reviews, are almost impossible to maintain, work on issues & fix the bugs.

App with no organisation consumes more time, and chance that you forgot something and later will have an issue dramatically increases.
Do we want or not, we will start thinking about the code re-organisation.

Otherwise, app designed with standard and architecture give us possibility to decompose functionality,
or group semantically same parts into modules.
This gives possibility to delegate different development stages on different teams:
 team A work on User functionality, team B responsible for content management, etc..
